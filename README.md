Transfer Learning for Business Cycle Identification

Abstract

A deep learning model is proposed as a strategy for identifying business cycles. The approach integrates the idea of storing knowledge gained from one regionâ€™s economics experts and applying it to other geographic areas. The first is captured with a supervised deep neural network model and the second by applying it to another dataset, a transfer learning procedure. The hyperparameters were tuned using a grid search process. The empirical results indicate that the strategy proposed leads to successful business cycle identification.
