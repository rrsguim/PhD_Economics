# Transfer Learning and Macroeconomics

A transfer learning approach is proposed as an additional strategy for empirical macroeconomics. When developing economics modeling strategies, the lack of data may be an issue that transfer learning can fix. As we show empirically, data from different but related domains, a type of transfer learning, helps identify the business cycle phases when there is no business cycle dating committee or to estimate a quick first economic-based output gap. In both cases, the proposed strategy also helps to improve the learning when data is limited. The approach integrates the idea of storing knowledge gained from one regionâ€™s economics experts and applying it to other geographic areas. The first is captured with a supervised deep neural network model, and the second by applying it to another dataset, a domain adaptation procedure. The results indicate the method proposed leads to successful business cycle identification and output gap estimation.
