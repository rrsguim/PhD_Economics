# Deep Learning Macroeconomics

Econometrics, the branch of economics concerned with applying statistical and mathematical methods to economic problems, is a relevant and constantly expanding area of research. One of the questions always open is where to use a particular method, especially when presenting remarkable performance in other areas of knowledge, as deep learning nowadays. Several machine learning techniques are incorporated into the econometric framework, but deep learning remains focused on time-series forecasting. The approaches proposed here are related to pattern recognition, where deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance. When we apply econometrics to macroeconomic problems, limited datasets and complex nonlinear relationships are among the challenges that may emerge. This research proposes deep learning as an approach to transfer learning in the former case and to map relationships between variables in the latter case.

Firstly, transfer learning is proposed as an additional strategy for empirical macroeconomics. When developing economics modeling strategies, the lack of data may be an issue that transfer learning can fix. We start presenting theoretical concepts related to transfer learning and proposed a connection with a typology related to macroeconomic models. Next, we explore the proposed strategy empirically, showing that data from different but related domains, a type of transfer learning, helps identify the business cycle phases when there is no business cycle dating committee and to quick estimate a economic-based output gap. In both cases, the strategy also helps to improve the learning when data is limited. The approach integrates the idea of storing knowledge gained from one regionâ€™s economics experts and applying it to other geographic areas. The first is captured with a supervised deep neural network model, and the second by applying it to another dataset, a domain adaptation procedure. Overall, there is an improvement in the classification with transfer learning compared to baseline models. To the best of our knowledge, the combined deep and transfer learning approach is underused for application to macroeconomic problems, indicating that there is plenty of room for research development.

Secondly, since deep learning methods are a way of learning representations, those that are formed by the composition of multiple non-linear transformations, to yield more abstract repre- sentations, we apply deep learning for mapping low-frequency from high-frequency variables, a task also known as interpolation, distribution, and extrapolation of time series by related series.

The outstanding results obtained show the suitability of deep learning models applied to macroeconomic problems. First, models learned to classify United States business cycles cor- rectly. Then, applying transfer learning, they achieved outstanding performance in identifying the business cycles of out-of-sample Brazilian and European data. Along the same lines, the models learned to estimate the output gap based on the U.S. data and obtained excellent performance when faced with Brazilian data. In both cases, the proposed strategy emerges as a potential sup- plementary tool for governments and the private sector to conduct their activities in the light of national and international economic conditions. Additionally, deep learning proved adequate for mapping low-frequency variables from high-frequency data to interpolate, distribute, and extrap- olate time series by related series. The application of this technique to Brazilian data proved to be compatible with benchmarks based on other techniques.
