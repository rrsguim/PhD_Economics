Draft 1 - Nowcasting GDP with Deep Feedforward Networks

Abstract:
A relevant task in applied economics is finding metrics that represent the current state of the economy. There is vast information out there, but it is not usually straightforward enoughÂ to isolate the signal from the noise. The gross domestic product (GDP) is the most-watched current state indicator of the economy, but due to the intrinsic complexity of its calculation, the official GDP data are usually published quarterly and with lag that can take months. As a result, many coincidental indicators with a wide range of techniques have been developed in economics. In this work, we adopted feed-forward, deep neural networks known as universal approximators, as an approach for nowcasting the GDP.  With the end-to-end strategy allowed by this technique, we mapped a set of high-frequency variables to build an indicator that fits the GDP. We tested the performance of this strategy with data from the United States and Brazil. The results indicate that this approach must belong to the group of nowcasting routines.
